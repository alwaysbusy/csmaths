description: More advanced use of logic operations
---

Quantifiers allow the properties of a value to be expressed more concisely than would be possible with standard logic operations, and are used in combination with a logic statement.

## Existential

The existential quantifier is used to mean there is a value such that the statement is true. For example, the statement $EE x, x > 5$ is satisfied by any value that is 6 or greater. Therefore the statement, beginning with the quantifier followed by a statement, is true. It is also though of as meaning "there exists a value such that ...".

## Universal

The universal quantifier is used to mean that for all values the statement is true. For example, the statement $AA x, x*x = x^2$ is satisfied by any value. The example given for existential, if the existential operator were replaced with the universal, would not hold true since there would be values for which it did not hold.
